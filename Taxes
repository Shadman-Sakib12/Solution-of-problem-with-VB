     In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation. The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.   
        
        answer
        
        Dim a As Double
        Dim e As Double
        Dim c As Double
        Dim d As Double

        Console.WriteLine("Enter the current salary")
        a = Console.ReadLine
        If a <= 2000.0 Then
            Console.WriteLine("no tax")



        ElseIf a >= 2000.01 & a <= 3000.0 Then
            c = 8 / 100
            d = a - 2000.0
            e = d * c

        ElseIf a >= 3000.01 & a <= 4500.0 Then
            c = 18 / 100
            d = a - 2000.0
            e = d * c

        ElseIf a > 4500.0 Then
            c = 28 / 100
            d = a - 2000.0
            e = d * c



        End If


        Console.WriteLine("tax = " & e)
