 Sub main()

        Dim a As Integer = 0
        Dim b As Integer
        Dim c As Integer
        Console.WriteLine("enter the number")
        c = Console.ReadLine


        While a <> (c + 1)
            b = a Mod 2
            If b <> 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(a)
            End If
            a = a + 1

        End While
