Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.

answer

Sub main()

        Dim a As Double
        Dim v As Double
        Console.WriteLine("enter the radius of the sphere")
        a = Console.ReadLine
        v = (4 / 3) * (3.14159) * (a ^ 3)

        Console.WriteLine("the volume = " & v)
    End Sub
