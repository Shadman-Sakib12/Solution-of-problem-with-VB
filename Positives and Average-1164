Sub main()
        Dim a As Integer
        Dim b As Integer
        Dim c As Integer = 0
        Dim d As Integer
        Console.WriteLine("enter the first number")
        For b = 0 To 5
            a = Console.ReadLine
            If a > 0 Then
                c = c + 1
                d = d + a

            End If
        Next
        Console.WriteLine("Positive numbers = " & c)
        Console.WriteLine("average = " & (d / 6))





    End Sub
