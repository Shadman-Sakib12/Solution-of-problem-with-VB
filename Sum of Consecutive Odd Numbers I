ANSWER


Sub main()

        Dim a As Integer = 0
        Dim b As Integer
        Dim c As Integer
        Dim d As Integer
        Dim e As Integer = 0
        Console.WriteLine("enter the first number")
        c = Console.ReadLine


        Console.WriteLine("enter the second number")
        d = Console.ReadLine

        For b = c To (d - 1)
            a = b Mod 2
            If a <> 0 Then
                e = e + b

            End If

        Next
        Console.WriteLine("the sum of the odd numbers is " & e)



    End Sub
