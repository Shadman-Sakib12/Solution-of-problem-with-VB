 Sub main()
        Dim a As Integer
        Dim b As Integer
        Dim c As Integer
        Dim d As Integer
        Console.WriteLine("enter the number")
        a = Console.ReadLine
        For b = 1 To a
            c = b Mod 2
            If c = 0 Then
                d = b ^ 2
                Console.WriteLine(b & " ^2 = " & d)

            End If
        Next

    End Sub
